### Index
[1.](p1.c) Write a program in C-language to find the lower triangular square root of a pd matrix. Also test your program on (E6) of Unit 15

[2.](p2.c) Consider $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)^t ~ \mathcal{N}_3(\mu, \Sigma)$ . Write a program in C-language to find the marginal distributions of $y_1, y_2,$ and $y_3$ . Also extend it to find the conditional distribution of $y_1$, given $y_2$ and $y_3$ . Also test your program on Example 1 of Unit 16

[3.](p3.c) Write a program in C-language to fit the model $Y_i = b_0 + b_1 X_{1i} + b_2 X_{2i} + e_i$ where $i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ using the least squares estimates.

[4.](p4.c) Write a program in C-language to find the multiple correlation coefficient and the mean square error, if $\Sigma_{xx},\; \sigma_yy,$ and $\sigma_{xy}$ are given.

[5.](p5.c) Write a program in 'C' languageto show that the matrix $A$ is orthogonal. 
$$
A = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & -1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Also, extend the program to check that the columns of $A$ form an orthonormal basis of $R^4$

[6.](p6.c) Write a program in 'C' language to develop an orthogonal matrix of order 3 x 3 such that the elements in the first row are equal

[7.](p7.c) Write a programme is 'C' languageto find the ML estimation of mean ($\mu$) and variance $\sigma^2$

[8.](p8.c) Write a program in 'C' language to compute Hotelling $T^2$

[9.](p9.c) Write a programme in 'C' language to test the equality of mean vectors when covariance matrices are equal.

[10.](p10.c) Write a program in 'C' language to test for covariance matrix to be equal to a given matrix.

0 & 0 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$



[13.](p13.c) Write a programme in 'C' language to find the principal components from a correlation matrix and test it for the data given in Example 2

$$
\Sigma =

4 & 100
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0.4 \\
0.4 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$



[14.](p14.c) Write a programme in C-language to write the factor model of a covariance matrix given in Example 1

\Sigma =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0.63 & 0.45 \\
0.63 & 1 & 0.35 \\
0.45 & 0.35 & 1
