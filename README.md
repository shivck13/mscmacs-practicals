### üìö MSCMACS Practicals
This repository contains all practical codes developed for the practical sessions of the Master of Science in Mathematics with Applications in Computer Science (M.Sc MACS) programme offered by IGNOU. The practicals are categorized course-wise, in line with the official curriculum.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This repository is maintained for educational and revision purposes only. Please adhere to your university's academic integrity guidelines.

### üéØ Objective
* To provide a centralized, well-organized collection of working source code and supporting documentation for all the practical components in the M.Sc (MACS) programme. This helps learners:
* Practice and revise coding concepts
* Prepare effectively for term-end practical exams
* Supplement their theoretical learning with hands-on implementation
